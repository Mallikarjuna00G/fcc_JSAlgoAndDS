`ipynbGenerator.py` script shall be updated to latest project and run to get the project specific jupyter notebook. Thus, generated notebook will be just an outline. You shall update the project specific jupyter notebook.

**Note:** Using Node.js to run the scripts, since we need to run some/most of the javascript files without using them in html files

Command used will be of the format: `node <scriptName>`. Currently using Node.js version v18.19.0. Node.js can be obtained from <https://nodejs.org/en>.
