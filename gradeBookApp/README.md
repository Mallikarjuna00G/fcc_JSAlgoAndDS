# Review JavaScript Fundamentals by Building a Gradebook App

In this mini project, you will get to review JavaScript fundamentals like functions, variables, conditionals and more by building a gradebook app.

This will give you an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.

## Step1:

<p>A teacher has finished grading their students' tests and needs your help to calculate the average score for the class.</p>

<p>Complete the <code>getAverage</code> function which takes in an array of test scores and returns the average score.</p>

<p>The average is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the total number of scores.</p>

<p>A couple of function calls have been provided for you so you can test out your code.</p>

## Step2:

<p>Now the teacher needs your help converting the student score to a letter grade.</p>

<p>Complete the <code>getGrade</code> function that takes a number <code>score</code> as a parameter. Your function should return a string representing a letter grade based on the score.</p>

<p>Here are the scores and their corresponding letter grades:</p>

## Step3:

<p>The teacher is really happy with the program you have created so far. But now they want to have an easy way to check if a student has a passing grade. A passing grade is anything that is not an <code>"F"</code>.</p>

<p>Complete the function <code>hasPassingGrade</code> that takes a student score as a parameter. Your function should return <code>true</code> if the student has a passing grade and <code>false</code> if they do not.</p>

## Step4:

<p>Now that the teacher has all of the information they need, they want to be able to message the student with the results.</p>

<p>Complete the <code>studentMsg</code> function with <code>totalScores</code> and <code>studentScore</code> for parameters. The function should return a string representing a message to the student.</p>

<p>If the student passed the course, the string should follow this format:</p>

<p>If the student failed the course, the string should follow this format:</p>

<p>Replace <code>average-goes-here</code> with the average of the total scores.
Replace <code>grade-goes-here</code> with the student's grade.</p>
